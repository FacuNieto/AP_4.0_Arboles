Fuller's London Pride;Bitter - English;Fuller Smith & Turner PLC;Fuller Smith & Turner PLC Fuller's London Pride;Notes:Not just the iconic ale of the capital, London Pride is an all-British affair that unites a nation of beer drinkers.

Rich, smooth and elegant on the palate, it draws to a clean, satisfying finish with beautifully balanced bitterness.4.1% ABV on cask, 4.7% ABV for bottles, cans and kegs.\t;4.7;20;35;21;49;9;58;67;32;0;33;101;6;108

Creemore Springs UrBock;Bock - Traditional;Creemore Springs Brewery Limited;Creemore Springs Brewery Limited Creemore Springs UrBock;Notes:Bock beers gained notoriety in Munich back in 1612. All the Bavarian nobles were drinking fashionable northern ales known as Einbeck Bier. So Duke Maximillian I of Munich hired his own northern brewmaster, who created a lager similar in character but superior in taste. It won back the local aristocrats. Inspired by his entrepreneurial spirit we started brewing our own urBock – rich, ruby-hued beer with subtle, dark roasted flavours. It’s an aristocratic beer but rest assured, you needn’t be a Duke to enjoy it.28 IBU\t;6;20;30;9;54;11;34;85;18;0;29;45;9;115

Brown Ale;Brown Ale - American;Brooklyn Brewery;Brooklyn Brewery Brooklyn Brown Ale;Notes:This is the award-winning original American brown ale, first brewed as a holiday specialty, and now one of our most popular beers year-round. Northern English brown ales tend to be strong and dry, while southern English brown ales are milder and sweeter. Brooklyn Brown Ale combines the best of those classic styles and then adds an American accent in the form of a firm hop character and roasty palate. A blend of six malts, some of them roasted, give this beer its deep russet-brown color and complex malt flavor, fruity, smooth and rich, with a caramel, chocolate and coffee background. Generous late hopping brings forward a nice hop aroma to complete the picture. Brooklyn Brown Ale is full-flavored but retains a smoothness and easy drinkability that has made it one of the most popular dark beers in the Northeast.\t;5.6;25;45;15;70;4;43;60;6;0;2;33;1;109

The long, dry finish of this balanced, mild Trappist beer will stay with you.Trappist or Dubbel?In 1865 the monks of Westmalle started brewing a dark Trappist beer in addition to their table beer. They adjusted the recipe in 1926, doubling the amounts of raw ingredients to produce a new, stronger beer. Dubbel is a logical name for this doubled beer, though it is more often simply called ‘Trappist’. To this day, the 1926 recipe is the basis for Westmalle Dubbel.Westmalle Dubbel: bottle and tapWe are all familiar with Westmalle Dubbel in 33 cl bottles. But around 150 carefully selected Belgian cafés and restaurants serve this beer on tap from barrels containing 20, 30 and 50 litres. In the barrel, this living beer evolves differently to emerge with a slightly sweeter taste.Westmalle Dubbel can also be purchased in 75 cl bottles. The beer matures in a different way in a larger bottle to produce a noticeably milder finish.\t;7;15;30;24;47;39;23;113;49;0;89;33;31;92

Brother Joseph's Belgian Dubbel;Dubbel;Straight To Ale;Straight To Ale Brother Joseph's Belgian Dubbel;Notes:Maimed in an accident that left him with a hunched back, Brother Joseph Zoettl worked in the St. Bernard Abbey power plant shoveling coal. In his spare time, Brother Joseph used found objects such as marbles and chunks of concrete and tile to build miniature shrines and buildings on the Abbey grounds. Over 40 years, he created 125 different models and replicas. Today, the Ave Maria Grotto covers three acres and is world-renowned as both a fun roadside attraction and an awe-inspiring collection of folk art. We have named our Belgian dubbel after Brother Joseph as a testament to his perseverance, his hard work, and his indomitable spirit. A full-flavored abbey-style ale with a complex taste and aroma, Brother Joseph’s Dubbel is filled with specialty malt and dark fruit character.\t;8;15;30;10;29;14;17;96;25;0;63;24;21;66

You see we had a couple of really good years (thank you very much) and so heading into this season while we are awaiting the January delivery of a new brewhouse we are jammin’ along brewing 80 barrels of IPA and PILS and such every 3 hours. A couple of months back we realized that since we can only brew a mere 60 barrels of Shugga’ every 5 hours, that we were seriously screwed. For every case of Shugga’ brewed, we’d short 3 cases of our favorite daily beers. It’s a drag. This year, we brewed something that we think is also cool and brews more like our daily brews. The new brewhouse will help insure this kind of failure never happens again. It’s a mess that we can not brew our BrownShugga’ this year and we suck for not doing it. There is nothing cool about screwing this up this badly and we know it. Maybe we can sue our own sorry selves. There is no joy in our hearts this holiday and the best we can hope for is a quick and merciful end. F*@& us. This totally blows. Whatever. We freaking munch moldy donkey butt and we just want it to be all over... So this substitute beer is a ‘Cereal Medley’ of Barley, Rye, Wheat, and Oats….

Hop extracts are for the BIG brewers, he thought - suitable only for crummy sub-standard and barely-passable industrial lagers, not the subtle and elegant craft beer made here. But wrong he was. The New Brewer does not eschew any possible inputs. In this case the mountain of extracts will replace the mountain of hop vegetative material in the kettle thus creating cleaner hop flavors and preventing the otherwise spinach-like mess of a kettle full of super-hopped wort from clogging up a pump or worse. The sensuous honey-like amber ooze was administered intravenously to the wort kettle and the sacrament was complete.

GUBNA’s post-fermentation dry-hopping with both hops allows this monstrosity to gently coax the citrus rind and grapefruit aroma while providing a rye malt-induced, spicy-yet-round middle, and a brisk, clean bitter finish (10 percent ABV, 100+ IBUs).\t;10;65;100;13;33;22;70;52;57;1;81;93;7;53

Well this beer is almost the same just double the flavor and alcohol. We actually took the Crooked Tree recipe and doubled all of the ingredients except the water, just the way a DOUBLE should be made. Big hops balanced with tons of malt give this beer a huge body. Although this beer is as cool as ""The Fonz"" when first purchased, it gets really mellow and smooth with some age. After a year or two stored in a cool dark place you'll notice the heavy caramel and malt flavors are trying to sneak past the hops. This beer is hugely delicious so it will need your undivided attention (the chores can wait....trust us). 98 IBUs\t";12;65;100;9;42;42;54;58;24;0;33;65;6;74

Fearless Youth;Lager - Munich Dunkel;Grimm Brothers Brewhouse;Grimm Brothers Brewhouse Fearless Youth;Notes:Once upon a time in the land of Bavaria, a darkness fell upon the beer in the town of Munich. But have no fear – this darkness was born of a toasted malt that produces a bready chocolate flavor. This full-bodied brew is now known as a Munich Dunkel. Our dunkel is made with just enough hoppy bitterness to scare away any overt sweetness. Then it is carefully lagered to produce a cleaness that no one will shudder at.\t;5.2;15;25;21;52;8;37;95;18;0;32;39;6;129

Iris;Lambic - Traditional;Brasserie Cantillon;Brasserie Cantillon Cantillon Iris;"Notes:It is a completely original beer which, contrary to the other products of the Brewery, is not brewed with 35% of wheat. The Iris, which is only made with malt of the pale ale type (giving a more amber colour to the beer) conserves the typical flavour of the spontaneous fermentation, the complex aromas and the vinous taste.The hopping is different too. Lambic is made with 100% dried hops, for the Iris we use 50% of dried hops and 50% of fresh hops. The latter cause a superb acidity, the former, due to their tannins, enable to conserve the beer while preserving all its qualities. After two years in the barrel, the Iris undergoes a second fresh hopping two weeks before the bottling. A linen bag, filled with hops, is soaked in the beer for two weeks. This technique, called ""cold hopping"", gives the beer a more intense savour and makes the smell and the taste more bitter.Iris is brewed only once every season and all the beers come from the same brewing. This is why the beer is dated. The second fermentation is obtained by adding liquor. Although it is a spontaneous fermentation beer, the Iris is very different from the Lambic. The amber colour and the bitter and slightly caramelized taste make it a complex beer.\t";6.5;0;10;69;34;16;90;59;191;4;123;100;17;56

And though it's released each year as a separate vintage, BA has been informed that the recipe is only slightly tweaked from year to year, while the ABV remains at 8.5%.As the new Head Brewer, this 2017 edition of Vintage Ale champions a new American hop variety Denali, used to give the beer a citrusy, pine-like flavour and a new British malt variety Laureate. Combined with trusty British hops Target and Goldings, our 21st Vintage Ale is a well-rounded and balanced beer wilh Fuller's yeast adding the orange, marmalade characters to it. Vinlage ale is an exceptional beer, only available from Fuller's as a limited release of individually packaged and numbered bottles and will improve for many years to come, like a fine wine or whisky. As the beer is bottle conditioned it will form a natural sediment, so pour carefully, sit back and enjoy the very finest of Fuller's ales.\t;8.5;30;65;5;67;44;35;79;31;0;63;42;12;90

Old Peculier;Old Ale;T & R Theakston Ltd.;T & R Theakston Ltd. Theakston Old Peculier;Notes:Old Peculier is possibly one of the country’s most well-known and loved ales. This unique, beautiful brew is often imitated but never matched and is sold literally all over the world. With countless awards to its credit, it is something of which every Briton can be very proud and is the epitome of the greatest of British brewing tradition.In the early years of the modern brewing era, about two hundred years ago, many brewers produced a dark, strong ‘stock’ beer in the winter months, to provide a base amount of fermented beer to add to beers brewed in the rather more volatile months of the summer.Old Peculier probably owes its origins to this. The name pays tribute to the unique ecclesiastical status of Masham as a ‘Court of the Peculier’ and is also reference to the strong characteristic of the beer! For many years it was affectionately referred to as Yorkshire’s ‘Lunatic’s Broth’.\t;5.6;30;65;10;36;22;40;88;32;2;61;38;9;97

Orval Trappist Ale;Pale Ale - Belgian;Brasserie d'Orval S.A.;Brasserie d'Orval S.A. Orval Trappist Ale;Notes:Orval beer is a high fermentation beer. The ageing process adds a fruity note, which strikes a subtle balance between the beer’s full-bodied yet complex flavour and bitterness.The beer was first brewed in 1931 and owes its unparalleled taste to the quality of the water, the hops and the yeast used. The brewery has selected very aromatic and unique hop varieties, which hark back to the first brewmaster of Orval, who hailed from Bavaria. The beer’s aromas are very pronounced while maintaining the right level of bitterness thanks to the English method of dry hopping.The various stages of fermentation – combined fermentation with the original yeast and with wild yeast, followed by fermentation in the bottle – mean the beer must age for some time and requires numerous quality controls.\t;6.9;20;30;23;23;17;39;38;70;0;39;56;24;23

Delicate in body, Singel’s mellow, dry finish culminates a truly ethereal experience. Hardywood Singel's stylistic inspiration originates with the Trappist brewers of western Europe, who are often celebrated for their gloriously complex dubbels and tripels, and whose devotion to crafting heavenly libations is second to none. Unknown to many, some of the Trappist brewers also brew a milder ale for daily consumption within the walls of the monastery.

Pilsner;Pilsner - German;Brooklyn Brewery;Brooklyn Brewery Brooklyn Pilsner;Notes:Brooklyn Pilsner is a refreshing golden lager beer, brewed in the style favored by New York’s pre-prohibition brewers. In the 1840’s, the pilsner style emerged from central Europe to become the world’s most popular style of beer. Like its ancestors, Brooklyn Pilsner is traditionally brewed from the finest German two-row barley malts. German-grown Perle and Hallertauer hops provide a crisp, snappy bitterness and fresh, floral aroma. The flavor of the malt comes through in the finish. We ferment Brooklyn Pilsner at cool temperatures, and then give it a long, gentle maturation (lagering), which results in a beer of superior complexity and smoothness. We believe that you will find there to be none finer. Unlike mass-marketed so-called pilsners, Brooklyn Pilsner does not contain cheap fillers such as corn or rice, nor does it contain any preservatives or stabilizers. Brooklyn Pilsner is the real thing.\t;5.1;25;40;35;29;7;54;13;8;8;9;72;2;49

The Great’ER Pumpkin;Pumpkin Beer;Heavy Seas Beer;Heavy Seas Beer Heavy Seas - The Great Pumpkin;Notes:In the most worthy of pumpkin patches and during the silence of the midnight hour, the Greater Pumpkin raises up and pours a rich deep and burnished orange color. Heady aromas of bourbon, cinnamon, ginger, allspice and clove linger seductively over the thick white head of this tremendous brew. Its love at first sip as the full malt body, dominated by British crystal malt, brown sugar and pumpkin, slowly washes over your tongue. Bourbon barrel aging rounds out the flavors with notes of oak, vanilla, and bourbon. Pairs well with crisp autumn weather, crunchy fallen leaves, and the knowledge that your kids will be asleep soon so you can raid their Halloween candy bags.\t;10;5;70;9;40;90;11;45;20;1;77;5;113;83

Gritty McDuff 's Scottish Ale is returns every January to help you weather the season. Scottish Style Ale is our interpretation of the robust brews native to Scotland. Generous quantities of Pale malt along with Munich and Caramalts give this ale a deep and complex profile. Scottish Style Ale is just a shade darker than our Bitter, with a rich, slightly sweet first impression on the palate that rounds out to a satisfying maltiness and a medium-dry hop finish. At 6.3% ABV it's hearty but not overwhelming. Sure to please the Braveheart in all of us.25 IBU\t;6.3;9;25;23;63;21;46;71;20;0;15;52;14;116

Black Mocha Stout;Stout - American;Highland Brewing;Highland Brewing Highland Black Mocha Stout;Notes:Highland’s most robust beer, having a very malty body with a large, roasted chocolate flavor, all achieved solely through the use of special roasted barley grains. It is black in color with a very clean finish and moderate hop flavor. While the porter style was developing, some brewers produced a stout porter and over time generated a new style known simply as stout. These beers traditionally contain a distinct roasted malt flavor and can run the gamut from a dry stout, such as Guinness to a sweet stout such as Watney’s Cream Stout. Our Black Mocha falls in the sweet stout range and derives its chocolate and coffee tones from the use of appropriate roasted malt grains and is very often used as an after dinner libation or an accompaniment to dessert.\t;5;35;60;18;79;5;66;59;2;0;2;18;5;139

This golden beer opens with a bold blast of spicy Noble hops, courtesy of Saaz and Hallertau Mittlefruh, and gives way to the fruity aromas offered by our traditional Belgian yeast. Brewed with Pilsner and Munich malts, Trippel is classically smooth and complex, and sings with a high-note of sweet citrus before a pleasantly dry finish delivers a warm, strong boozy bite. Give Trippel a sip to get you smiling.\t;8.5;20;40;15;30;24;17;42;34;0;47;27;31;26

Merry Monks;Tripel;Weyerbacher Brewing Co.;Weyerbacher Brewing Co. Merry Monks' Ale;Notes:Merry Monks, 9.3% ABV, is a Belgian-style Tripel. Pilsner malt combined with an Abbey yeast strain yields a remarkable and complex flavor packed with notes of spice, banana and pear. Nicely balanced, with a moderate to dry finish.Merry Monks is bottle conditioned which imparts a special effervescence to the beer and a creamier carbonation. The ongoing fermentation inside the bottle will change the character of the beer as it ages and you’ll find it becomes dryer with age. You may want to lay down a few bottles for future evaluation. We suggest storing at cellar temperatures (around 55°F) and away from light.This brew is available year-round. Keep your eye out for Merry Monks in 25 oz. cork-and-cage champagne bottles for an exceptional experience!\t;9.3;20;40;19;29;44;12;64;50;0;85;15;47;41

Sapient Trip Ale;Tripel;Dark Horse Brewing Company;Dark Horse Brewing Company Dark Horse Sapient Trip Ale;"Notes:Why is the Grim Reaper holding a mailbox? Well, that mailbox is from a dead Dark Horse beer. The Grim Reaper better know as ""Death"" was quite found of our classic Sapient Summer Wheat Ale. When we changed it into a Belgian Style Triple, Death thought it would only be appropriate to bring something from that beer into this beer. So he picked the mailbox, and we weren’t about to argue with him. You can say what you want about him, but that Death sure has a big heart. So anyway...we brewed this beer with a Trappist yeast strain so it is very traditional. The flavors are incredibly complex with notes of mild fruit and finishes with a bit of clove. Although this beer is higher in alcohol it is very smooth and finishes dry on the palate.\t";9.5;20;40;13;35;19;20;36;44;4;69;22;27;27

Brother David’s Triple is brewed with copious amounts of pale malts as well as Belgian candi sugar, giving it a deep golden hue, medium body and rich mouth feel. The dense head gives off aromas of candied orange peel, clover honey, pears, and a hint of freshly mown fields.

UFO Hefeweizen;Wheat Beer - American Pale;Harpoon Brewery;Harpoon Brewery UFO Hefeweizen;Notes:UFO Hefeweizen is an American unfiltered wheat beer. Perhaps UFO’s initial sensory perception is also its most prominent: a cloudy golden color and a dense, frothy head. The yeast, which has not been filtered out, accounts for the cloudiness of UFO. Wheat malt tends to create a larger head than barley malt, the cereal grain most often used in brewing. When served in a traditional wheat beer glass with a lemon, UFO presents an appealing and distinctive visual image.The aroma has a faint but clear citrus-like character. This is produced by the special yeast and accounts for the Bavarian tradition of serving hefeweizens with a lemon. The lemon accentuates the yeast’s fruity, tart fragrance. UFO has a soft mouthfeel and a refreshing, light body. The wheat malts and subtle hopping give the beer a mild, delicate flavor. UFO has a clean finish. Unlike some imported hefeweizens, UFO does not have the spicy, tropical flavors typical of European-brewed style.19 IBU\t;4.8;10;35;9;36;4;16;25;54;0;71;25;27;80
